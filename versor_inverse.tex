Also, this should be consistent with the same result for a wedge product in the special case that the wedged vectors are perpendicular.  For a wedge of two vectors $A = \Bx \wedge \By$, we have
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:xtox:80}
\begin{aligned}
\gpgradezero{A^\dagger A}
&= \gpgradezero{(\By \wedge \Bx)(\Bx \wedge \By)} \\
&= \By \cdot \lr{ \Bx \cdot (\Bx \wedge \By)} \\
&= \By^2 \Bx^2 - \lr{\Bx \cdot \By}^2.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
If $A$ was a versor, then \(\Bx \cdot \By = 0\), so you are left with just the product of the magnitudes.
