%\chapter{A fun application of Green's functions: Residue calculus}
%\label{chap:residueGreens}

\section{Motivation.}
A fun application of both Green's functions and geometric algebra is to show how the Cauchy integral equation can be expressed in terms of the Green's function for the 2D gradient.  This is covered, almost as an aside, in \citep{doran2003gap}.  I found that treatment a bit hard to understand, so I am going to work through it here at my own pace.
\subsection{Complex numbers in geometric algebra.}
Anybody who has studied geometric algebra is likely familiar with a variety of ways to construct complex numbers from geometric objects.  For example, complex numbers can be constructed for any plane.  If \( \Be_1, \Be_2 \) is a pair of orthonormal vectors for some plane in \R{N}, then any vector in that plane has the form
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:residueGreens:20}
\Bf = \Be_1 u + \Be_2 v,
\end{equation}
has an associated complex representation, by simply multiplying that vector one of those basis vectors.  For example, if we pre-multiply \( \Bf \) by \( \Be_1 \), forming
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:residueGreens:40}
\begin{aligned}
z
&= \Be_1 \Bf \\
&= \Be_1 \lr{ \Be_1 u + \Be_2 v } \\
&= u + \Be_1 \Be_2 v.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
We may now identify the unit bivector \( \Be_1 \Be_2 \) as an imaginary, designed by \( i \), since it has the expected behavior
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:residueGreens:60}
\begin{aligned}
i^2 &=
\lr{\Be_1 \Be_2}^2 \\
&=
\lr{\Be_1 \Be_2}
\lr{\Be_1 \Be_2} \\
&=
\Be_1 \lr{\Be_2
\Be_1} \Be_2 \\
&=
-\Be_1 \lr{\Be_1
\Be_2} \Be_2 \\
&=
-\lr{\Be_1 \Be_1}
\lr{\Be_2 \Be_2} \\
&=
-1.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
\subsection{Cauchy-equations in terms of the gradient.}
It is natural to wonder about the geometric algebra equivalents of various complex-number relationships and identities.  Of particular interest for this discussion is the geometric algebra equivalent of the Cauchy equations that specify required conditions for differentiability.

If a complex function \( f(z) = u(z) + i v(z) \) is differentiable, then we must be able to find the limit of
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:residueGreens:80}
\frac{\Delta f(z_0)}{\Delta z} = \frac{f(z_0 + h) - f(z_0)}{h},
\end{equation}
for any complex \( h \rightarrow 0 \), for any possible tradjectory of \( z_0 + h \) toward \( z_0 \).  In particular, for real \( h = \epsilon \),
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:residueGreens:100}
\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{u(x_0 + \epsilon, y_0) + i v(x_0 + \epsilon, y_0) - u(x_0, y_0) - i v(x_0, y_0)}{\epsilon}
=
\PD{x}{u(z_0)} + i \PD{x}{v(z_0)},
\end{equation}
and for imaginary \( h = i \epsilon \)
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:residueGreens:120}
\lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0} \frac{u(x_0, y_0 + \epsilon) + i v(x_0, y_0 + \epsilon) - u(x_0, y_0) - i v(x_0, y_0)}{i \epsilon}
=
-i\lr{ \PD{y}{u(z_0)} + i \PD{y}{v(z_0)} }.
\end{equation}
Equating real and imaginary parts, we see that existence of the derivative requires
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:residueGreens:140}
\begin{aligned}
\PD{x}{u} &= \PD{y}{v} \\
\PD{x}{v} &= -\PD{y}{u}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
These are the Cauchy equations.  When the derivative exists in a given neighbourhood, we say that the function is analytic in that region.  If we use a bivector interpretation of the imaginary, with \( i = \Be_1 \Be_2 \), the Cauchy equations are also satisfied if the gradient of the complex function is zero, since
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:residueGreens:160}
\begin{aligned}
\spacegrad f
&=
\lr{ \Be_1 \partial_x + \Be_2 \partial_y } \lr{ u + \Be_1 \Be_2 v } \\
&=
\Be_1 \lr{ \partial_x u - \partial_y v } + \Be_2 \lr{ \partial_y u + \partial_x v }.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
We see that the geometric algebra equivalent of the Cauchy equations is simply
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:residueGreens:200}
\spacegrad f = 0.
\end{equation}
Roughly speaking, we may say that a function is analytic in a region, if either \cref{eqn:residueGreens:140} or \cref{eqn:residueGreens:200} (the function is differentiable) in a neighbourhood of all points in that region.
\subsection{Fundamental theorem of geometric calculus.}
The next piece of the puzzle is the two parameter variant of the fundamental theorem of geometric calculus.  The statement of that theorem is
\maketheorem{Fundamental theorem for surface integrals (2D).}{thm:surfaceintegral:100}{
Given a continuous and connected surface \( S = \Bx(u, v) \), \( \Bx \in \mathbb{R}^2 \), parameterized by \( u \in [u_0, u_1], v \in [v_0, v_1] \), multivector functions \( F(\Bx), G(\Bx) \) that are differentable over \( S \), a (bivector-valued) area element \( d^2 \Bx = d\Bx_1 \wedge d\Bx_2 = du dv\, \Bx_u \wedge \Bx_v \), and \( \spacegrad = \Bx^u \partial_u + \Bx^v \partial_v \), then
\begin{equation*}
\int_S F d^2\Bx \lrspacegrad G = \ointclockwise_{\partial S} F d\Bx G,
\end{equation*}
where \( \partial S \) is the boundary of the surface \( S \).
} % theorem
This also holds for general two parameter surfaces in any dimension, but in that case, the curvilinear representation of the gradient, as stated above, is called the vector derivative, and is denoted by \( \boldpartial \) (also acting bidirectionally).

To get the idea how this works, let's perform a 2D rectangular coordinate expansion of the area integral
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:residueGreens:180}
\begin{aligned}
\int_S F I dx dy \lrspacegrad G
&=
\sum_{k=1}^2 \int_S dx dy \partial_k \lr{ F I \Be_k G } \\
&=
\int dy \evalrange{ \lr{F I \Be_1 G} }{x_0}{x_1}
+
\int dx \evalrange{ \lr{F I \Be_2 G} }{y_0}{y_1} \\
&=
-\int dy \evalrange{ \lr{F \Be_2 G} }{x_0}{x_1}
+
\int dx \evalrange{ \lr{F \Be_1 G} }{y_0}{y_1}.
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
This is illustrated in \cref{fig:orientedIntegral:orientedIntegralFig1}, which shows pictorially that the remaining integral is an oriented line integral.

If we want to approximate a more general area, we may do so with additional tiles, as illustrated in \cref{fig:orientedIntegrals:orientedIntegralsFig2}.  The final answer can be evaluated along the exterior boundary, with a result equal to the sum of all internal tiles, as any interior contributions cancel exactly.
