- Furin cleavage site in spike proteins was known lead to enhanced ACE2 binding.  Very interesting for those studying viral virualance and transmissibility, as it would increase both.
- Darpa paper seeking funding for furin cleavage site insertion and experimentation at WIV.
- This type of work had been done by WIV on other viruses.
- Initial WIV reporting on SARS-CoV-2 omitted all mention of this unique feature, even though they were geared up to detect it, and had already experimented
  with inserting it into other viruses (i.e. they knew the importance of this feature.)
- The origins of all the viral samples most closely related to SARS-CoV-2 were suppressed and obscured by WIV in reporting and papers.
- Lots of bat viruses have been found genetically similar to SARS-CoV-2 (in particular, the ones that were omitted from WIV reporting).  All of these show small letter substitutions showing mutations.  If SARS-CoV-2 was natural, would expect a family of mutations with similar letter substitutions at the furin cleavage site.  After 2 years nothing like that found yet.
- China did a fabulous job tracing the origins of the original SARS.  This is described beautifully in the book, and one is left with spectacular respect that for the thoroughness of that work, and the capabilities of the all the investigators.  If that level of thorough investigation has occured here, the details have been kept secret.  They are acting very guilty.
- This screams out as a cover-your-ass scenerio.  The attempts to politize the blame game by describing China as developing biowarefare agents have not been helpful.
- The WHO investigators were fed useless data, not allowed to actually investigate, and were populated with investigators that had a vested interest in suppressing a thorough investigation.

My conclusion is that, in all probability, SARS-CoV-2 originated as a natural (bat) virus, enhanced genetically or by passage through human cells or humanized mice, to increase human virualance and transmissibility (i.e. using well known methods.)  This was surely done by those with well meaning intentions, but somebody got careless or unlucky, and it escaped, and this escape was subsequently covered up.

What we probably have here is a jointly developed and funded American and Chinese project that got loose.  Trump calling this "the Chinese virus" was extremely unhelpful, to say the least, as it politized the topic.  We now now in an absurd situation with left-wingers defending the natural origins hypothesis, and right-wingers defending the lab-leak hypothesis.

Rampant censorship has prevented discussion of this possibility for most of the last two years.  It has been a thought crime to raise the possibility that this was engineered, or even just collected and accidentally released, but that is slowly changing.  

Even if the thought crime of wanting to understand the origins of the SARS-CoV-2 endemic, it is still a thought crime to question the efficicy or safety or lack of long term safety data for the new genetic manipulation vaccines.  It is still a thought crime to consider any non-vaccine treatment protocols.  It is still a thought crime to question the benefits of lockdowns or vaccine passports or vaccine mandates.  It is still a thought crime to question the benign altruism of the pharmasutical companies that are profiting from government imposed vaccination schemes and coercion.  It is still a thought crime to question the conflict of interest of the media pushing fear porn that is not aligned with facts (hard enough that people are willing to give up their lives, and succumb to unbelievable levels of authoritarianism.)  It is still a thought crime to acknowledge all of the lying, statistical manipulation, and bogus modelling that has led to so much fear.  It is still a thought crime to acknoweldge that a huge proportion of covid deaths were of individuals with multiple comorbidities, many of whom were over the average age of death.  It is still a thought crime to question the policies that prevented people in care homes from going to hospitals, or those policies that pushed covid positive patients from being returned to care homes to lessen hospital load.  It is still a thought crime to admit that "covid-cases" statistics have been mostly meaningless for most of the last two years, and that it has been well known that PCR testing with the high thresholds used were useless. It is still a thought crime to acknoledge the correlation of low vitamin-D levels and obesity that underlies so many severe covid outcomes.  It is probably still a thought crime to wonder if those that funded work that could have created a more virulant and human transmittable form of an originally bat only coronavirus, are also financial beneficiaries of the vaccines that are the only approved way to treat this new disease.
